# 🧠 Titanic Survival Prediction Using Machine Learning

**🗓 Duration:** April 2025  
**🎯 Goal:** To gain hands-on experience in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) by building a predictive model and deploying it using **Streamlit**.

---

## 📌 Project Description

This project uses the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival outcomes based on features such as age, sex, fare, and class. It applies fundamental machine learning techniques for classification and is intended to build experience in:

- Data preprocessing and visualization  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Web deployment using **Streamlit**

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Scikit-learn  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Streamlit (for deployment)  
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 🚀 Deployment

The project has been deployed using **Streamlit**.  
🔗 **Live App:** [View the Titanic Survival Prediction App](https://your-streamlit-app-link)

> _(Replace `https://your-streamlit-app-link` with your actual Streamlit deployment link.)_
