# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction Using Machine Learning

**📆 Duration:** April 2025  
**🎯 Purpose:** The aim of this project is to apply core concepts of Machine Learning to build a predictive model that determines whether a passenger on the Titanic would have survived based on historical data. It also includes a deployed **Streamlit web app** for interactive predictions.

## 📌 Project Description

This project uses a dataset from the Kaggle Titanic competition to train a classification model that predicts survival outcomes. The project workflow includes:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Deployment of a Streamlit app

The project is intended as a learning experience to enhance understanding of machine learning pipelines, feature handling, and web app deployment.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

The model used is **Logistic Regression**, selected for its simplicity and interpretability. Other models like Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbors were also tested during experimentation.

### Features Used:
- Passenger Class (`Pclass`)
- Sex (`Sex`)
- Age (`Age`)
- Fare (`Fare`)
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard (`SibSp`)
- Number of parents/children aboard (`Parch`)
- Embarked Port (`Embarked`)

## 🌐 Live Demo

You can access the deployed Streamlit application using the link below:

🔗 **[Titanic Survival Prediction App](https://titanic-survival-prediction-ml-fmdtdzra8xpyutwbw8dycg.streamlit.app/)**

The app allows users to enter custom values for features like age, gender, and class to receive real-time predictions on survival probability.
