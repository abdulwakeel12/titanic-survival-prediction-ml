# 😷 Face Mask Detection Using CNN

**📆 Duration:** June 2025  
**🎯 Purpose:** The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to predict whether a person is wearing a **face mask** or not. The project includes a deployed **Streamlit web app** that allows users to interactively upload images for real-time predictions.

## 📌 Project Description

This project uses a pre-trained **CNN model** to detect face masks in images. The workflow includes:

- Data collection and preprocessing
- Model training using TensorFlow
- Deployment of a Streamlit web app

This project serves as an interactive and easy-to-use face mask detection system. The goal is to demonstrate how to deploy machine learning models with **Streamlit** and implement a useful real-time prediction tool.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

The model used in this project is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, which has been trained to distinguish between images of people wearing masks and those without masks.

### Features Used:
- Image pixels (resized to 224x224 for model input)

The model processes an image, performs feature extraction using CNN layers, and then classifies it as either "Mask" or "No Mask" based on the output.

## 🌐 Live Demo

You can access the deployed **Streamlit** application using the link below:

🔗 **[Face Mask Detection App](https://your-username-your-repository-name-your-app-path.streamlit.app/)**

The app allows users to upload an image, and the model will predict whether the person is wearing a mask or not.
